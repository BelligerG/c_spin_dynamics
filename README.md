# c_spin_dynamics

The class "SpinDynamics" will allow the generation of objects that can be used to calculate the yields to measure the MFEs for different orientations and numbers of radicals. By providing the object with the spins, the class can handle spins other than 1/2, which can provide hyperfine interactions of non-standard spin nuclei.
